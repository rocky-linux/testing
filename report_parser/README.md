# Usage:

`report_parser.py` is a Python executable that takes two parameters. The two parameters are the name of the input file
and the name of the output file. The input file is a report generated by `xsos`. The output file is a YAML file.

## Example:

The following parses an `xsos` report and dumps output to `output.yaml`:

`~$ python3 report_parser.py input_xsos_report.out output.yaml`
