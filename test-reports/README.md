# Rocky Linux Testing Team Test Reports

## Requirements

The script included in this repository require the use of `xsos`.

```bash
xsos - https://github.com/ryran/xsos
```

*`xsos` is [discussed](https://access.redhat.com/discussions/469323) on an upstream vendor's website.*

## Installing `xsos`

Follow the guide...

```bash
curl -Lo ./xsos bit.ly/xsos-direct
chmod +x ./xsos
dnf install -y pciutils # Needed for lspci
```

## Using `xsos`

```bash
sudo ./xsos -x --bios --os --cpu --disks --ethtool --lspci --mem --mpath | \
    tee "${HOME}/$(sudo dmidecode -t 1 | awk '/UUID:/ {print $2}').xsos.out"
cat *.xsos.out
```

### Scrubbing Private Information

`xsos` will let you scrub information from the report which is probably a good idea. If you wish to scrub everything automatically before uploading using the following comand instead. This will generate a random UUID instead of using your system UUID.

```bash
sudo ./xsos -x --bios --os --cpu --disks --ethtool --lspci --mem --mpath --scrub | \
    tee "${HOME}/$(uuidgen).xsos.out"
cat *.xsos.out
```

The above will generate a unique identifier that is not tied to your system instead of using the one generate by the kernel for your machine. If you do this be sure to keep track yourself of which machine is which in your testing if you test multiple systems. To that end you may which to manually scrub / sanitize the output of `xsos`.

### Containers

See the [README.md](./container/README.md) in the containers sub-directory.

## Report Contents

The report generated will likely have more information than is needed but it isn't as much as generated by `dmidecode` + `lspci` and `sosreport` combined acting as a summarizing tool for all of those (if available).

Here is a sample...

## Reporting

Find the proper location in the filesystem hierarchy being used to organize reports and add a directory to the tree. You may need to add your vendor and likely will need to add a directory for your model.

Please replace `space` characters in all vendor and model names with `underscore` characters as you will see in the samples already uploaded.

The final directory in the hierarchy should be unique. You can use the `UUID` of your system or you can generate your own `UUID` with `uuidgen`. Both methods are shown below.

## Hierarchy

The reports for different targets are stored in a filesystem hierarchy to allow reports for specific configuration be quickly found. The prefered format is Resource -> Vendor -> Model/Version -> Rocky major version -> UUID. This format allows for the easiest sorting and lookup of information, though sub-categories are allowed.

* Resource is one of four: cloud, container, hardware, hypervisor.
* Vendor is the primary company (eg: Supermicro, Naver cloud, etc.)
* Model is the best description of the model. Some make this easy, others may need to specify model with the generation. (for container and hypervisor there might not be a model but instead a version, use the major/minor version which is feature stable)
* Rocky major version: rl8 or rl9
* If you are submitting multiple information files, please included them in a sub-folder that matches the systems UUID. If it is a single file, then no sub-directory is sufficent.
